  a. Contains both Final Project & Project 3 Equipment.

Notes:
- Ulises microSD has been flashed with the new image for project 3.
  a. As of 7:20pm, he is having issues initializing the LCD and Raspberry Pi 5.
     - As of 7:36pm, Ulises is still having trouble and thus John & Ulises will try to use John's laptop to initialize the LCD and Raspberry Pi 5.
  b. As of 7:22pm, John is messing with the provided example skeleton codes.
  c. As of 7:23pm, Liam is taking notes & also messing with the provided example code.
  d. Devin is in class and shall join the group at 8pm.
- John setup a group GitHub for our code.
  a. GitHub Link: https://github.com/JohnDavidVill/elec424proj3
  b. The Python script (file), in our GitHub, named "graDudes_script.py" contains the hearty meat of our skeleton code (not full skeleton code, sadly).
- Ulises wants a backup microSD to also be flashed with the new Raspberry Pi 5 image :)
- Devin arrived @ 8:04pm and the plan is to have him redo the initial instructions of the project to see if maybe a fresh set of eyes can help us get the LCD and Raspberry Pi 5 initialized.

Miscellaneous Notes:
- Being an ELEC is 10% cool shii and 90% debugging hardware/software.
- According to Devin's sources, Project 3 is straightforward. The FINAL PROJECT, however, is a nightmare!
- Apparently, a MECHE on a MSNE senior design team is gonna FAIL! Bro, literally hasn't shown up to a single team meeting this semester and was already warned last semester for his poor work ethic.
- DJ Dev!!!
